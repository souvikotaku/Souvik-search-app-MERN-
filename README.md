# Souvik-search-app-MERN-
I made this simple search Phone numbers with name app by using MERN stack. There are a lot of phone numbers given there on the list, you can search for a particular phone number by clicking on search button and then entering name in the search bar of the modal. You can only see the results if you are logged in. So ,create an account and log in and then you can see the search results. I have used jwt authentication on the back end to authenticate user. and also protected the routes on react.


Check out the live app here
https://souvik-search-app.herokuapp.com/

I have also uploaded the docker images of the app to a dockerhub repo, here's the link
https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/souvikotaku/node-search-app

(note: Since this is my first time creating containers, images and pushing to docker, if there is any messup then kindly forgive. You can also check out the app on heroku if there's any problemÂ in running the docker images on your system. Also, there might be a delay in loading the phone number in the table once the page loads, if it happens then click on login/register on the navbar, then go back again to the dashboard, the numbers should show up this time.)
