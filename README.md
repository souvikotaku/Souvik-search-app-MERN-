# Souvik-search-app-MERN-
I made this simple search Phone numbers with name app by using MERN stack. There are a lot of phone numbers given there on the list, you can search for a particular phone number by clicking on search button and then entering name in the search bar of the modal. You can only see the results if you are logged in. So ,create an account and log in and then you can see the search results. I have used jwt authentication on the back end to authenticate user. and also protected the routes on react.
